		I’m Dan — a curious, hands-on kind of person who’s spent life learning by doing. From coding
		apps to rebuilding engines, I love the process of figuring things out. My background isn’t
		traditional, but it’s been full of growth, resilience, and a whole lot of self-taught lessons.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-300 md:text-xl">
		I’ve worked in machine shops, helped raise my niece, kept old cars running way past their prime,
		and now I build web apps with heart and intention. I care about doing things well, being useful,
		and staying grounded.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-300 md:text-xl">
		You’ll usually find me with my dog Red by my side, learning something new, or helping someone
		out. If you're into building, creating, or just connecting over honest work, get in touch!
